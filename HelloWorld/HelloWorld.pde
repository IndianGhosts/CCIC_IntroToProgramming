/** My name is Anay!
*My name comes from a nickname.
*There is a Hindu god named Vishnu.
*Overtime he was nicknamed in myths.
*My name Anay is one of his nicknames.
*My parents also decided onto this name due to my family.
*My sister was going to be named Anya and they wanted us to have similar names.
*So swapping the a and y at the end with it meaning something was genius in their eyes.
